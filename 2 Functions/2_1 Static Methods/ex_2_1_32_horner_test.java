/*
/32.Horner's method. Write a class Horner.java with a method double eval(double x, double[] p) that evaluates the polynomial p(x) whose coefficients are the entries in p[]:
p0 + p1x1 + p2x2 + ... + pN-2xN-2 + pN-1xN-1 
Use Horner's method, an efficient way to perform the computations that is suggested by the following parenthesization:
p0 + x (p1 + x( p2 + ... + x(pN-2 + xpN-1))...)
Write a test client with a static method exp() that uses Horner.eval() to compute an approximation to e^x, using the first N terms of the Taylor series expansion e^x = 1 + x + x ^2/2! + x ^3/3! + .... Include code to check your answer against that computed by Math.exp().
